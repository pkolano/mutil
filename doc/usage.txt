Using Mutil
===========

The mcp and msum utilities of Mutil are drop-in replacements for the
standard cp and md5sum programs from GNU coreutils.  Hence, they can be
used in exactly the same manner with the same options.  The Mutil
versions, however, contain performance and functionality enhancements
accessed through additional command-line options.

3. Option notes

    3.1. Buffer management

        3.1.1. Buffer size

            The --buffer-size option defines the buffer size that is
            used in reads and writes.  In general, the larger the buffer
            size, the greater the performance.  Note, however, that a
            large buffer size may not be practical on multi-user systems
            due to additional resource consumption.

        3.1.2. Double buffering

            The --double-buffer option enables the use of double
            buffering for reading/writing (mcp w/o hashing),
            reading/hashing (msum), and writing/hashing (mcp w/
            hashing).  This option allows individual operations to be
            overlapped with each other and should always be used to
            maximize performance.

        3.1.3. Direct I/O

            The --direct-read and --direct-write options enable the
            use of direct I/O between memory and disk, bypassing kernel
            buffers.  Always enable these options if possible for
            fastest performance from a single node.  If a file system
            does not support direct I/O, --fadvise-read is recommended
            as an alternative.

            Note that --direct-read and --direct-write are mutually
            exclusive with --fadvise-read and --fadvise-write,
            respectively, and that --direct-write is not applicable to
            msum.

        3.1.4. posix_fadvise

            The --fadvise-read and --fadvise-write options enable the
            use of posix_fadvise() to inform the kernel about buffer
            access patterns.  These options are useful for preventing
            thrashing of the buffer cache for other processes running
            on the same system.  The --fadvise-write option has a large
            negative impact on performance due to the synchronization of
            each block that must be performed for it to have any effect.
    
            Note that --fadvise-read and --fadvise-write are mutually
            exclusive with --direct-read and --direct-write,
            respectively.

    3.2. File splitting

        The --split-size option defines the point at which file
        processing will be divided amongst multiple threads/nodes.
        This option is required to achieve maximum performance on large
        files.

        Note that the split size must be a power of 2 and will be
        adjusted up as needed.  The split size must also be greater than
        the buffer size and hash leaf size.  Setting the split size to
        less than 1 GB is not recommended as overhead increases with
        the number of splits.

    3.3. Multi-threading

        The --threads option defines how many OpenMP worker threads will
        be used for file operations.  Note that --split-size must be
        greater than zero for this to have any benefit on large files.
        Also note that either direct I/O or posix_fadvise should always
        be used with multiple threads or else thrashing of the buffer
        cache will likely eliminate any benefits of multi-threading.

    3.4. Multi-node processing

        Mcp and msum support two mutually-exclusive multi-node models:
        TCP and MPI.  MPI has simpler command-line parameters for
        environments that support it, but TCP is more portable.

        3.4.1. TCP multi-node processing

            3.4.1.1. Manager node

                In the TCP model, one host is defined to be the manager
                node using the --listen-port option, which defines the
                TCP port through which worker nodes will contact the
                manager.  Communication is secured using TLS-SRP
                initialized with a plaintext password stored in the
                file defined by the --password-file option.

                Note that the contents of --password-file should *NOT*
                be you login password.  The password is not used for
                login...it is only used to secure network communication.
                Mcp and msum will automatically generate a strong
                password if the file does not exist (recommended).
                The same password file can be used for multiple
                invocations.

                The manager generates two additional files it needs for
                authentication at the same location as the password
                file, but with ".mg" and ".pw" extensions.  These
                files are only used by the manager.

            3.4.1.2. Worker nodes

                A worker node processes various file tasks parceled out
                by the manager node.  The --manager-host option defines
                the host name or IP address of the manager node that
                is listening on the TCP port defined by the
                --manager-port option.  Each worker must also be given a
                --password-file option that defines the location of the
                password file given to the manager.  This file may need
                to be copied to worker nodes if they do not have access
                to the same file system.  The ".mg" and ".pw" files do
                not need to be copied.

                Note that all other options given to workers should be
                identical to those given to the manager.  The file
                arguments, however, should be omitted.  Changing the
                other options will have unknown and/or undesirable
                results.

        3.4.2. MPI multi-node processing

            The --mpi option enables the use of MPI for multi-node
            processing.  The same exact options and arguments are given
            to all nodes.  
                
    3.5. Hashing

        The --print-hash option to mcp will enable the computation of
        hashes for each file that will be printed to standard out.
        In msum, this option is unnecessary as hashes are printed by
        default.  By default, the target file name is shown.  The
        --print-src option can be used to alternatively show the source
        file name.

        The --hash-type option changes the type of hash computed.  The
        hash types supported by mcp and msum are dependent on the hash
        types compiled into the local Libgcrypt installation.  Consult
        the corresponding man page or invoke mcp/msum with --help to
        see the list of supported hashes.

        Note that when --split-size is greater than zero, hash trees
        are used to combine the hash results of individual file chunks.
        Hence, the output will not conform to the output of the
        corresponding hash type without splitting.  The benefit of
        splitting, however, is much greater performance on large files.
        When the file size is less than the split size, the hash tree
        value will match the standard hash value.

        The --check-tree option will print the root hashes of each split
        subtree instead of combining the result into a single hash
        value.  When used with msum's -c option, msum will print the
        ranges of the file that are corrupted, if applicable, at the
        granularity of the split size.

        The --hash-leaf-size can be used to change the granularity of
        the hash tree.  This option, however, is mainly intended to be
        used with another option that is currently disabled.
      
        The output of mcp using --print-hash will conform to the
        output of msum as long as the same --check-tree, --hash-type,
        --hash-leaf-size, and --split-size options are used.

    3.6. Statistics

        The --print-stats option will print various performance stats to
        standard error for each individual file or file split together
        with total stats.  By default, the target file name is shown.
        The --print-src option can be used to alternatively show the
        source file name.

    3.7. Partial transfers

        The --offset and --length options can be used to copy/sum a
        portion of a file.  The offset specifies the starting position
        in the source file and the length specifies the number of bytes
        to copy/sum.  By default, the same offset will be used in both
        the source and destination files.  The --dst-offset option can
        be used to specify a different offset in the destination file.

    3.8. Batch transfers

        The --read-stdin option allows an arbitrary batch of file copies
        or checksums to be performed.  For mcp, each line read on stdin
        must be of the form "SRC DST RANGES", where SRC and DST are file
        names and RANGES is zero or more comma-separated ranges.  For
        msum, each line must be of the form "FILE RANGES".  All files
        must be URI-escaped (not URIs but escaped in a similar manner)
        according to RFC 3986.  The following perl function demonstrates
        how file names can be escaped:

            sub escape {
                my $text = shift;
                $text =~ s/([^A-Za-z0-9\-_.!~*'()\/])/sprintf("%%%02X", ord($1))/eg
                    if (defined $text);
                return $text;
            }

        Each range in the set of optional ranges is defined "START-END",
        where 0 <= START < END.  For example, "1-3,10-12" would operate
        on bytes 1,2,10,11.

    3.9. Temporary permissions

        During a copy of read-only files, mcp temporarily uses
        permissions on the target file that are the same as the source
        file, but with owner write permission.  For some purposes, it
        desirable to retain these temporary permissions instead of
        restoring the original permissions.  For example, this can be
        used when detecting corruption that may have occurred due to
        transient errors and the corrupted portion must be written
        again.  To skip the final chmod that will bring the target file
        back to the source permissions, the --skip-chmod option
        can be used.

    3.10. Lustre striping

        By default, the striping of files transferred from one Lustre
        file system to another that have a stripe count other than the
        system default will be preserved.  Files that have the default
        stripe count or come from a non-Lustre file system will be
        restriped to one stripe per GB.  The --stripe-count option
        allows files to be striped either to an absolute number of
        stripes (e.g. 4), a number of stripes per source GBs when the
        given value is followed by 's' (e.g. 0.25s), or a number of
        stripes per --length GBs when the given value is followed by 'l'
        (e.g. 4.5l).


4. Performance

    See https://pkolano.github.io/papers/lisa10.pdf for (old) expected
    performance numbers.  Note that the results reported in this paper
    were measured using dedicated compute nodes and near-idle file
    systems.  The actual performance observed in practice will depend
    upon the characteristics of your environment.
